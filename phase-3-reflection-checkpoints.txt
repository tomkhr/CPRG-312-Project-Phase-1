Phase 3 Reflection Checkpoints:

# Part B:

For this part i learned how important input validation is for keeping a website safe. Without validation users could type things that break the system or even try to inject code or script. For example, if someone puts HTML or JavaScript into a form and the server saves it that can laed to XSS attacks, running the code inside another person’s browser. Output encoding helps prevent this because it turns special characters into safe strings that can’t be executed so even if someone tries something malicious it will just show up as text.

I had a challange with the form on my user dashboard page not prefilling with the user data even though I was logged in. It took some figuring out to understand that i should not use Postman as it does not behave the same with javascript as a browser did. I then was able to log in using the console in the browser and go to dashboard page. although probably crating a login html page could help. then i did have an issue with not being able to successfuly update the profile/user info from dashboard. after i moved my dashboard JS script from being a part of the script tag in my dashboard.html to being it's own dashboard.js file, the issue fixed itself and i finally was able to update the user data, refresh the page, and see the changes.

# Part C:

Using outdated third-party libraries can be risky because older versions may have known security issues that attackers can exploit. When I ran npm audit i only had two low-severity vulnerabilites, and npm outdated showed three packages behind, but I chose not to update them because everything is currently working and I’ve had updates break my code before. if this were an app i would push to production, i would be sure do extensive reseach and update i needed. I also set up automation with GitHub Actions to run security checks automatically, even though the workflow failed. Automation is helpful because it keeps track of vulnerabilities and updates for me but it can also cause issuess if updates run without being tested first.

# Part D:

I tested my app for both XSS and SQL injection attacks. I tried common XSS inputs like <script>alert(1)</script> and <img onerror="alert(1)"> in the profile form and confirmed that all of them were stripped or sanitized and nothing executed in the browser. I also tested SQL-style injection attempts during login and they were treated as normal text and rejected. Thanks to how the project was set up with validation, sanitizing, and proper escaping, the application stayed safe and didn’t allow any of these attacks to work.

Using tools like OWASP ZAP could help catch issues faster thanks to automating scans and simple test scripts would make it easier to find problems without doing everything manually.
